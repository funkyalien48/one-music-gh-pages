                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do some of the brightest stars go unnoticed? Well, sometimes, they simply don’t want to be noticed. Sometimes, they only want their <i>shine</i> to be noticed but the stars themselves wish not to be identified. This is the ideology that Anya Solo goes by when it comes to her music. “I don't want fame. I would like for my work to be recognized, but I don't want to be recognized. I just want people to enjoy my music,” she said as she pondered about what her ultimate goals were. 
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/>  <br/>Anya Solo is a remarkable, multitalented, and severely underrated musical artist who records and produces every single part in her songs. She is so true to herself when she makes these songs, that no genre can encompass the sounds that she has organized into wonderful works of art. When I asked her about this, she said, “Honestly, it just comes from the heart.” Most artists try to put labels on their works for the sake of familiarity and popularity, but Anya has moved past these superficial desires. She is the embodiment of authenticity. Proof of this is the fact that she actively avoids the use of samples in the song making process; opting instead to come up with beautiful melodies and harmonies generated by utilizing the many instruments she knows how to play. From the way that she intertwines all the sounds to create her songs to the way she can make words into poems, everything about Anya Solo is simply amazing.
                                  
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/>   <br/>  Anya’s journey into music production started when she was 14. She was really lucky that her high school had a Music Technology class. Before seeing it in the course catalogue, she had no idea it existed. Once she enrolled, however, everything changed. “They taught us how to use all the different programs like Reason [and] Logic. And when I discovered that, I was thriving,” she emphasized, “That’s when I discovered my passion with music production.” Suddenly, all the songs that were only conceptualized were able to be transcribed into reality. Just like a painter, she already had the full picture of her artwork in her head, all she needed now were the different brushes and tools needed to paint it. Fortunately, she had already known how to play piano since the age of nine. This skill would translate perfectly into the use of her little MIDI controller, which was given to her by a friend of hers that would eventually move to Korea and earn Platinum for making lo-fi beats.  
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/> <br/>She would eventually learn how to sing as well, but not exactly because she actively wanted to. “I remember being terrified; everyone in the class dreaded it so I didn’t want to,” she recalled as she looked back to the time when singing was part of an assignment for her Music Technology class. She eventually got over it and realized that her ideas also needed vocals in order to, “fill in the gaps.” As for the other instruments she plays (the drums, the guitar, and the bass), she simply picked them up and got good at them. As she puts it, “It’s just practice until I don’t suck.” The reason she learned how to play these is because, much like with her experience with vocals, she would have an idea and that idea required those instruments to fulfill it. 
                                 It goes without saying that she needed recording and mixing equipment as well. As a college student (yes, a college student), however, she hasn’t invested a lot of money into this equipment, saying that it’s “very [low] budget.” She added, “I have a nice microphone. It’s an AX Audio-Technica microphone. Asides from that I have a little MIDI controller I bought in high school, some studio monitors I got that were used, and my laptop.” She also owns an audio interface. All in all, this has cost her around a thousand dollars, proving that money is not a factor that plays into quality. 
                                  
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>   <br/>Having all the necessary tools to do so, she would officially start to write, produce, and release music. The way she goes about this process is quite particular. Usually, you’d expect an artist to write down everything they come up with in order to get consistent results, using their knowledge of music theory to make sure that everything goes well together. Not Anya Solo. No, she comes up with all the rhythms, melodies, and harmonies in her head, replicates them through her instruments, and figures out the formalities later. Hell, she refuses to even read sheet music in the first place, stating, “I don't like the traditional. I don't like the correct way of doing it. I like to learn by ear.” 
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/> <br/>The writing process occurs in one of two ways. The first way is the fiddle. In Anya’s words, “I kind of just mess around until something sounds good, and then I just go with that.” The second method is much more peculiar. There are times in which she’ll dream about a song, wake up, and try to record it based on loose memory. “I'm really blessed to have this,” she said.  Of course, things don’t always go her way. Sometimes she’ll record one of her ideas so that she can come back to them later. “This is bad.” This terrifying thought will come to her head on occasion (this doesn’t happen often, though). However, she’ll get a burst of inspiration to fix it and has managed to finish some of her favorite songs this way (“Honey Bear,” is a prime example of this). As always, the phoenix rises from the ashes.
                                Anya’s songs are something special. Some have this ethereal vibe to them that elevates your mind to a state of peaceful bliss. Some start out this way but then veer into the wall of chaos, yet still manage to be beautiful. This is perfectly shown in her song   <a href="   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92AIS886Lk"> "W/O U </a>.” Typically, the words are what give meaning to songs. In Anya’s case, however, the instrumentals also play a heavy role in portraying the meaning of her songs.   <a href="   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92AIS886Lk"> "W/O U" </a> starts off slightly ominously and then mellows out within a few bars. Once the song has managed to put you in a comfortable position, it abruptly snags you into a state of distress and uneasiness. Even this moment, however, doesn’t last long and you’re brought back to a sweet and tranquil melody. Of course, as a listener, one is now skeptical of this peace and expects a huge wave to hit later on. It doesn’t, though. Or at least, it does but you’re now ready for it. It’s almost like you let the chaos grow too much in your mind. This is a representation of Anya’s emotions. 
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/> <br/>The album from which “  <a href="   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92AIS886Lk"> W/O U </a>” came from (which is also called "<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92AIS886Lk"> W/O U </a>"), came about in a very emotionally difficult time. “It was a very good way for me to express that.   <a href="   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s92AIS886Lk"> W/O U </a> was the very first song I wrote for the album. It’s got a lot of meaning behind it. It’s a mellow song but when it gets eerie it’s kind of what I feel more. And I like the darkness of it. I like that it broke down and got distorted,” she said when explain what the song is about. Obviously not all of her songs have to have an incredibly deep meaning, even if it seems otherwise. “Don’t Wake Me,” a song from her first album, is literally about her being sleepy. That fact doesn’t keep this song from being a victim of pareidolia, having people interpret it as a metaphor for depression. “It's not always very creative or symbolic, but at the same time it can be, and people take it as such. And I don't have any problem with that,” were Anya’s thoughts on the manner. 
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/> <br/>Regardless of whether they have a deep meaning or a simple message, Anya’s songs are always thoroughly enjoyable.
                                
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <br/>  <br/>
                                Anya has come a long way in her music making, now being able to make a song within 10 minutes. Despite this incredible skill of hers, she still sees herself having a long way to go. “The song I'm most proud of is one I haven't made yet,” was a simple yet very impactful statement she made. Given what she has already done with her songs, one can only imagine what sort of revolutionizing masterpiece Anya has in her mind. 
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <br/><br/>Listening to her music is an experience I believe everyone should have. There’s something for everybody.
